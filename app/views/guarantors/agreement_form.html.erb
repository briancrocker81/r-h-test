      <h3 class="article-title">It is hereby agreed that:-</h3>
      <p>1. I agree to act as Guarantor for the person noted in Box 1 above who is proposing to enter into a Tenancy Agreement and make &nbsp;myself legally responsible (in the event of the proposed tenant being granted a tenancy) for payment of all outstanding rent and &nbsp;other charges if the tenant defaults in payment, upon demand. I agree to fully compensate the landlord for any loss, damage, &nbsp;costs or other expenses arising directly or indirectly out of any breach of the agreement. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>2. The Guarantor will also be liable for any increase in rent agreed between the landlord and any person acting on their behalf. &nbsp</p>
      <p>3. I have read the Tenancy Agreement and understand the terms and conditions of the tenancy as set out therein.</p>
      <p>4. I have been advised to take legal or professional advice in relation to this Guarantor Agreement and make this application in the full knowledge of the obligations in law that this Guarantor Agreement places upon me.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>5. All information given by me on this form is true and correct. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>6. In support of this document I understand the landlord may make a credit reference check or other form of check to confirm my &nbsp;identity.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>7. I confirm that I am not an undischarged bankrupt and there is no bankruptcy petition pending against me. The guarantee shall &nbsp;not be revocable by the guarantor nor will it be rendered unenforceable by the Guarantor's death or bankruptcy. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>8. I understand that my obligations under this Agreement shall commence on the Tenancy Commencement Date and shall &nbsp;continue throughout the period that the property is occupied by the tenant or any licensee and is not limited the term &nbsp;specified in the agreement. The Guarantee will continue throughout the tenancy or any extension/renewal in the property &nbsp;or other properties, or re-grant continuation of the Agreement whether for a fixed term or periodic tenancy and whether it &nbsp;is created by agreement between the landlord and the tenant or by operation of the law or otherwise. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>9. In the event of my death, my personal representatives or administrators shall notify the Landlord as soon as practicable and &nbsp;my estate shall assume liability for the Guarantor's obligations under this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>CONSIDERATION</strong></p>
      <p>The consideration for this guarantee is that the landlord agrees to let the property to the tenant(s).&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>GUARANTEE</strong></p>
      <p>The guarantor covenants with the landlord that the tenant will pay all rent made payable by and perform and observe all covenants, &nbsp;conditions and obligations contained in the tenancy agreement to be performed and observed by the tenant and will compensate the landlord &nbsp;in full on demand made in writing within 7 days for all liabilities incurred by the tenant in respect of the obligations and for all losses, damages, &nbsp;costs and expenses thereby arising or incurred by the landlord.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>WAIVER</strong></p>
      <p>The landlord may release or compromise the tenant's liability under the obligations or grant to either the tenant or the guarantor time or &nbsp;other indulgence without affecting the guarantor liability under this guarantee.</p>
